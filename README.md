The `portion` library (formerly distributed as `python-intervals`) provides data structure and operations for intervals in Python 3.6+.

 - Support intervals of any (comparable) objects.
 - Closed or open, finite or (semi-)infinite intervals.
 - Interval sets (union of atomic intervals) are supported.
 - Automatic simplification of intervals.
 - Support comparison, transformation, intersection, union, complement, difference and containment.
 - Provide test for emptiness, atomicity, overlap and adjacency.
 - Discrete iterations on the values of an interval.
 - Dict-like structure to map intervals to data.
 - Import and export intervals to strings and to Python built-in data types.
 - Heavily tested with high code coverage.

**Latest release:**
 - `portion`: 2.1.6 on 2021-04-17 ([documentation](https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/portion/blob/2.1.6/README.md), [changes](https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/portion/blob/2.1.6/CHANGELOG.md)).
 - `python-intervals`: 1.10.0 on 2019-09-26 ([documentation](https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/portion/blob/1.10.0/README.md), [changes](https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/portion/blob/1.10.0/README.md#changelog)).

 Note that `python-intervals` will no longer receive updates since it has been replaced by `portion`.

## Installation

You can use `pip` to install it, as usual: `pip install portion`.

This will install the latest available version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/portion).
Pre-releases are available from the *master* branch on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/portion)
and can be installed with `pip install git+https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/portion`.

The test environment can be installed with `pip install portion[test]` and relies on [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

`portion` is also available on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/portion).


## Documentation & usage

### Interval creation

Assuming this library is imported using `import portion as P`, intervals can be easily
created using one of the following helpers:

```python
>>> P.open(1, 2)
(1,2)
>>> P.closed(1, 2)
[1,2]
>>> P.openclosed(1, 2)
(1,2]
>>> P.closedopen(1, 2)
[1,2)
>>> P.singleton(1)
[1]
>>> P.empty()
()

```

The bounds of an interval can be any arbitrary values, as long as they are comparable:

```python
>>> P.closed(1.2, 2.4)
[1.2,2.4]
>>> P.closed('a', 'z')
['a','z']
>>> import datetime
>>> P.closed(datetime.date(2011, 3, 15), datetime.date(2013, 10, 10))
[datetime.date(2011, 3, 15),datetime.date(2013, 10, 10)]

```


Infinite and semi-infinite intervals are supported using `P.inf` and `-P.inf` as upper or lower bounds.
These two objects support comparison with any other object.
When infinities are used as a lower or upper bound, the corresponding boundary is automatically converted to an open one.

```python
>>> P.inf > 'a', P.inf > 0, P.inf > True
(True, True, True)
>>> P.openclosed(-P.inf, 0)
(-inf,0]
>>> P.closed(-P.inf, P.inf)  # Automatically converted to an open interval
(-inf,+inf)

```

Empty intervals always resolve to `(P.inf, -P.inf)`, regardless of the provided bounds:

```python
>>> P.empty() == P.open(P.inf, -P.inf)
True
>>> P.closed(4, 3) == P.open(P.inf, -P.inf)
True
>>> P.openclosed('a', 'a') == P.open(P.inf, -P.inf)
True

```

Intervals created with this library are `Interval` instances.
An `Interval` instance is a disjunction of atomic intervals each representing a single interval (e.g. `[1,2]`).
Intervals can be iterated to access the underlying atomic intervals, sorted by their lower and upper bounds.

```python
>>> list(P.open(10, 11) | P.closed(0, 1) | P.closed(20, 21))
[[0,1], (10,11), [20,21]]

```

Nested intervals can also be retrieved with a position or a slice:

```python
>>> (P.open(10, 11) | P.closed(0, 1) | P.closed(20, 21))[0]
[0,1]
>>> (P.open(10, 11) | P.closed(0, 1) | P.closed(20, 21))[-2]
(10,11)
>>> (P.open(10, 11) | P.closed(0, 1) | P.closed(20, 21))[:2]
[0,1] | (10,11)

```

For convenience, intervals are automatically simplified:

```python
>>> P.closed(0, 2) | P.closed(2, 4)
[0,4]
>>> P.closed(1, 2) | P.closed(3, 4) | P.closed(2, 3)
[1,4]
>>> P.empty() | P.closed(0, 1)
[0,1]
>>> P.closed(1, 2) | P.closed(2, 3) | P.closed(4, 5)
[1,3] | [4,5]

```

Note that simplification of discrete intervals is **not** supported by `portion` (but it can be simulated though, see [#24](https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/portion/issues/24#issuecomment-604456362)).
For example, combining `[0,1]` with `[2,3]` will **not** result in `[0,3]` even if there is
no integer between `1` and `2`.

### Interval bounds & attributes


An `Interval` defines the following properties:

 - `i.empty` is `True` if and only if the interval is empty.
   ```python
   >>> P.closed(0, 1).empty
   False
   >>> P.closed(0, 0).empty
   False
   >>> P.openclosed(0, 0).empty
   True
   >>> P.empty().empty
   True

   ```

 - `i.atomic` is `True` if and only if the interval is a disjunction of a single (possibly empty) interval.
   ```python
   >>> P.closed(0, 2).atomic
   True
   >>> (P.closed(0, 1) | P.closed(1, 2)).atomic
   True
   >>> (P.closed(0, 1) | P.closed(2, 3)).atomic
   False

   ```

 - `i.enclosure` refers to the smallest atomic interval that includes the current one.
   ```python
   >>> (P.closed(0, 1) | P.open(2, 3)).enclosure
   [0,3)

   ```

The left and right boundaries, and the lower and upper bounds of an interval can be respectively accessed
with its `left`, `right`, `lower` and `upper` attributes.
The `left` and `right` bounds are either `P.CLOSED` or `P.OPEN`.
By definition, `P.CLOSED == ~P.OPEN` and vice-versa.

```python
>> P.CLOSED, P.OPEN
CLOSED, OPEN
>>> x = P.closedopen(0, 1)
>>> x.left, x.lower, x.upper, x.right
(CLOSED, 0, 1, OPEN)

```

If the interval is not atomic, then `left` and `lower` refer to the lower bound of its enclosure,
while `right` and `upper` refer to the upper bound of its enclosure:

```python
>>> x = P.open(0, 1) | P.closed(3, 4)
>>> x.left, x.lower, x.upper, x.right
(OPEN, 0, 4, CLOSED)

```

One can easily check for some interval properties based on the bounds of an interval:

```python
>>> x = P.openclosed(-P.inf, 0)
>>> # Check that interval is left/right closed
>>> x.left == P.CLOSED, x.right == P.CLOSED
(False, True)
>>> # Check that interval is left/right bounded
>>> x.lower == -P.inf, x.upper == P.inf
(True, False)
>>> # Check for singleton
>>> x.lower == x.upper
False

```

### Interval operations

`Interval` instances support the following operations:

 - `i.intersection(other)` and `i & other` return the intersection of two intervals.
   ```python
   >>> P.closed(0, 2) & P.closed(1, 3)
   [1,2]
   >>> P.closed(0, 4) & P.open(2, 3)
   (2,3)
   >>> P.closed(0, 2) & P.closed(2, 3)
   [2]
   >>> P.closed(0, 2) & P.closed(3, 4)
   ()

   ```

 - `i.union(other)` and `i | other` return the union of two intervals.
   ```python
   >>> P.closed(0, 1) | P.closed(1, 2)
   [0,2]
   >>> P.closed(0, 1) | P.closed(2, 3)
   [0,1] | [2,3]

   ```

 - `i.complement(other)` and `~i` return the complement of the interval.
   ```python
   >>> ~P.closed(0, 1)
   (-inf,0) | (1,+inf)
   >>> ~(P.open(-P.inf, 0) | P.open(1, P.inf))
   [0,1]
   >>> ~P.open(-P.inf, P.inf)
   ()

   ```

 - `i.difference(other)` and `i - other` return the difference between `i` and `other`.
   ```python
   >>> P.closed(0,2) - P.closed(1,2)
   [0,1)
   >>> P.closed(0, 4) - P.closed(1, 2)
   [0,1) | (2,4]

   ```

 - `i.contains(other)` and `other in i` hold if given item is contained in the interval.
 It supports intervals and arbitrary comparable values.
   ```python
   >>> 2 in P.closed(0, 2)
   True
   >>> 2 in P.open(0, 2)
   False
   >>> P.open(0, 1) in P.closed(0, 2)
   True

   ```

 - `i.adjacent(other)` tests if the two intervals are adjacent, i.e., if they do not overlap and their union form a single atomic interval.
 While this definition corresponds to the usual notion of adjacency for atomic
 intervals, it has stronger requirements for non-atomic ones since it requires
 all underlying atomic intervals to be adjacent (i.e. that one
 interval fills the gaps between the atomic intervals of the other one).
   ```python
   >>> P.closed(0, 1).adjacent(P.openclosed(1, 2))
   True
   >>> P.closed(0, 1).adjacent(P.closed(1, 2))
   False
   >>> (P.closed(0, 1) | P.closed(2, 3)).adjacent(P.open(1, 2) | P.open(3, 4))
   True
   >>> (P.closed(0, 1) | P.closed(2, 3)).adjacent(P.open(3, 4))
   False
   >>> P.closed(0, 1).adjacent(P.open(1, 2) | P.open(3, 4))
   False

   ```

 - `i.overlaps(other)` tests if there is an overlap between two intervals.
   ```python
   >>> P.closed(1, 2).overlaps(P.closed(2, 3))
   True
   >>> P.closed(1, 2).overlaps(P.open(2, 3))
   False

   ```

Finally, intervals are hashable as long as their bounds are hashable (and we have defined a hash value for `P.inf` and `-P.inf`).


[&uparrow; back to top](#table-of-contents)
### Comparison operators

Equality between intervals can be checked with the classical `==` operator:

```python
>>> P.closed(0, 2) == P.closed(0, 1) | P.closed(1, 2)
True
>>> P.closed(0, 2) == P.open(0, 2)
False

```

Moreover, intervals are comparable using `>`, `>=`, `<` or `<=`.
These comparison operators have a different behaviour than the usual ones.
For instance, `a < b` holds if `a` is entirely on the left of the lower bound of `b` and `a > b` holds if `a` is entirely
on the right of the upper bound of `b`.

```python
>>> P.closed(0, 1) < P.closed(2, 3)
True
>>> P.closed(0, 1) < P.closed(1, 2)
False

```

Similarly, `a <= b` holds if `a` is entirely on the left of the upper bound of `b`, and `a >= b`
holds if `a` is entirely on the right of the lower bound of `b`.

```python
>>> P.closed(0, 1) <= P.closed(2, 3)
True
>>> P.closed(0, 2) <= P.closed(1, 3)
True
>>> P.closed(0, 3) <= P.closed(1, 2)
False

```

Intervals can also be compared with single values. If `i` is an interval and `x` a value, then
`x < i` holds if `x` is on the left of the lower bound of `i` and `x <= i` holds if `x` is on the
left of the upper bound of `i`.

```python
>>> 5 < P.closed(0, 10)
False
>>> 5 <= P.closed(0, 10)
True
>>> P.closed(0, 10) < 5
False
>>> P.closed(0, 10) <= 5
True

```

This behaviour is similar to the one that could be obtained by first converting `x` to a
singleton interval (except for infinities since they resolve to empty intervals).

Note that all these semantics differ from classical comparison operators.
As a consequence, some intervals are never comparable in the classical sense, as illustrated hereafter:

```python
>>> P.closed(0, 4) <= P.closed(1, 2) or P.closed(0, 4) >= P.closed(1, 2)
False
>>> P.closed(0, 4) < P.closed(1, 2) or P.closed(0, 4) > P.closed(1, 2)
False
>>> P.empty() < P.empty()
True
>>> P.empty() < P.closed(0, 1) and P.empty() > P.closed(0, 1)
True

```




[&uparrow; back to top](#table-of-contents)
### Interval transformation

Intervals are immutable but provide a `replace` method to create a new interval based on the
current one. This method accepts four optional parameters `left`, `lower`, `upper`, and `right`:

```python
>>> i = P.closed(0, 2)
>>> i.replace(P.OPEN, -1, 3, P.CLOSED)
(-1,3]
>>> i.replace(lower=1, right=P.OPEN)
[1,2)

```

Functions can be passed instead of values. If a function is passed, it is called with the current corresponding
value.

```python
>>> P.closed(0, 2).replace(upper=lambda x: 2 * x)
[0,4]

```

The provided function won't be called on infinities, unless `ignore_inf` is set to `False`.

```python
>>> i = P.closedopen(0, P.inf)
>>> i.replace(upper=lambda x: 10)  # No change, infinity is ignored
[0,+inf)
>>> i.replace(upper=lambda x: 10, ignore_inf=False)  # Infinity is not ignored
[0,10)

```

When `replace` is applied on an interval that is not atomic, it is extended and/or restricted such that
its enclosure satisfies the new bounds.

```python
>>> i = P.openclosed(0, 1) | P.closed(5, 10)
>>> i.replace(P.CLOSED, -1, 8, P.OPEN)
[-1,1] | [5,8)
>>> i.replace(lower=4)
(4,10]

```

To apply arbitrary transformations on the underlying atomic intervals, intervals expose an `apply` method that acts like `map`.
This method accepts a function that will be applied on each of the underlying atomic intervals to perform the desired transformation.
The provided function is expected to return either an `Interval`, or a 4-uple `(left, lower, upper, right)`.

```python
>>> i = P.closed(2, 3) | P.open(4, 5)
>>> # Increment bound values
>>> i.apply(lambda x: (x.left, x.lower + 1, x.upper + 1, x.right))
[3,4] | (5,6)
>>> # Invert bounds
>>> i.apply(lambda x: (~x.left, x.lower, x.upper, ~x.right))
(2,3) | [4,5]

```

The `apply` method is very powerful when used in combination with `replace`.
Because the latter allows functions to be passed as parameters and ignores infinities by default, it can be
conveniently used to transform (disjunction of) intervals in presence of infinities.

```python
>>> i = P.openclosed(-P.inf, 0) | P.closed(3, 4) | P.closedopen(8, P.inf)
>>> # Increment bound values
>>> i.apply(lambda x: x.replace(upper=lambda v: v + 1))
(-inf,1] | [3,5] | [8,+inf)
>>> # Intervals are still automatically simplified
>>> i.apply(lambda x: x.replace(lower=lambda v: v * 2))
(-inf,0] | [16,+inf)
>>> # Invert bounds
>>> i.apply(lambda x: x.replace(left=lambda v: ~v, right=lambda v: ~v))
(-inf,0) | (3,4) | (8,+inf)
>>> # Replace infinities with -10 and 10
>>> conv = lambda v: -10 if v == -P.inf else (10 if v == P.inf else v)
>>> i.apply(lambda x: x.replace(lower=conv, upper=conv, ignore_inf=False))
(-10,0] | [3,4] | [8,10)

```


[&uparrow; back to top](#table-of-contents)
### Discrete iteration

The `iterate` function takes an interval, and returns a generator to iterate over
the values of an interval. Obviously, as intervals are continuous, it is required to specify the
 `step` between consecutive values. The iteration then starts from the lower bound and ends on the upper one. Only values contained by the interval are returned this way.

```python
>>> list(P.iterate(P.closed(0, 3), step=1))
[0, 1, 2, 3]
>>> list(P.iterate(P.closed(0, 3), step=2))
[0, 2]
>>> list(P.iterate(P.open(0, 3), step=2))
[2]

```

When an interval is not atomic, `iterate` consecutively iterates on all underlying atomic
intervals, starting from each lower bound and ending on each upper one:

```python
>>> list(P.iterate(P.singleton(0) | P.singleton(3) | P.singleton(5), step=2))  # Won't be [0]
[0, 3, 5]
>>> list(P.iterate(P.closed(0, 2) | P.closed(4, 6), step=3))  # Won't be [0, 6]
[0, 4]

```

By default, the iteration always starts on the lower bound of each underlying atomic interval.
The `base` parameter can be used to change this behaviour, by specifying how the initial value to start
the iteration from must be computed. This parameter accepts a callable that is called with the lower
bound of each underlying atomic interval, and that returns the initial value to start the iteration from.
It can be helpful to deal with (semi-)infinite intervals, or to *align* the generated values of the iterator:

```python
>>> # Align on integers
>>> list(P.iterate(P.closed(0.3, 4.9), step=1, base=int))
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> # Restrict values of a (semi-)infinite interval
>>> list(P.iterate(P.openclosed(-P.inf, 2), step=1, base=lambda x: max(0, x)))
[0, 1, 2]

```

The `base` parameter can be used to change how `iterate` applies on unions of atomic interval, by
specifying a function that returns a single value, as illustrated next:

```python
>>> base = lambda x: 0
>>> list(P.iterate(P.singleton(0) | P.singleton(3) | P.singleton(5), step=2, base=base))
[0]
>>> list(P.iterate(P.closed(0, 2) | P.closed(4, 6), step=3, base=base))
[0, 6]

```

Notice that defining `base` such that it returns a single value can be extremely inefficient in
terms of performance when the intervals are "far apart" each other (i.e., when the *gaps* between
atomic intervals are large).

Finally, iteration can be performed in reverse order by specifying `reverse=True`.

```python
>>> list(P.iterate(P.closed(0, 3), step=-1, reverse=True))  # Mind step=-1
[3, 2, 1, 0]
>>> list(P.iterate(P.closed(0, 3), step=-2, reverse=True))  # Mind step=-2
[3, 1]

```

Again, this library does not make any assumption about the objects being used in an interval, as long as they
are comparable. However, it is not always possible to provide a meaningful value for `step` (e.g., what would
be the step between two consecutive characters?). In these cases, a callable can be passed instead of a value.
This callable will be called with the current value, and is expected to return the next possible value.

```python
>>> list(P.iterate(P.closed('a', 'd'), step=lambda d: chr(ord(d) + 1)))
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> # Since we reversed the order, we changed plus to minus in step.
>>> list(P.iterate(P.closed('a', 'd'), step=lambda d: chr(ord(d) - 1), reverse=True))
['d', 'c', 'b', 'a']

```



[&uparrow; back to top](#table-of-contents)
### Map intervals to data

The library provides an `IntervalDict` class, a `dict`-like data structure to store and query data
along with intervals. Any value can be stored in such data structure as long as it supports
equality.


```python
>>> d = P.IntervalDict()
>>> d[P.closed(0, 3)] = 'banana'
>>> d[4] = 'apple'
>>> d
{[0,3]: 'banana', [4]: 'apple'}

```

When a value is defined for an interval that overlaps an existing one, it is automatically updated
to take the new value into account:

```python
>>> d[P.closed(2, 4)] = 'orange'
>>> d
{[0,2): 'banana', [2,4]: 'orange'}

```

An `IntervalDict` can be queried using single values or intervals. If a single value is used as a
key, its behaviour corresponds to the one of a classical `dict`:

```python
>>> d[2]
'orange'
>>> d[5]  # Key does not exist
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
KeyError: 5
>>> d.get(5, default=0)
0

```

When the key is an interval, a new `IntervalDict` containing the values
for the specified key is returned:

```python
>>> d[~P.empty()]  # Get all values, similar to d.copy()
{[0,2): 'banana', [2,4]: 'orange'}
>>> d[P.closed(1, 3)]
{[1,2): 'banana', [2,3]: 'orange'}
>>> d[P.closed(-2, 1)]
{[0,1]: 'banana'}
>>> d[P.closed(-2, -1)]
{}

```

By using `.get`, a default value (defaulting to `None`) can be specified.
This value is used to "fill the gaps" if the queried interval is not completely
covered by the `IntervalDict`:

```python
>>> d.get(P.closed(-2, 1), default='peach')
{[-2,0): 'peach', [0,1]: 'banana'}
>>> d.get(P.closed(-2, -1), default='peach')
{[-2,-1]: 'peach'}
>>> d.get(P.singleton(1), default='peach')  # Key is covered, default is not used
{[1]: 'banana'}

```

For convenience, an `IntervalDict` provides a way to look for specific data values.
The `.find` method always returns a (possibly empty) `Interval` instance for which given
value is defined:

```python
>>> d.find('banana')
[0,2)
>>> d.find('orange')
[2,4]
>>> d.find('carrot')
()

```

The active domain of an `IntervalDict` can be retrieved with its `.domain` method.
This method always returns a single `Interval` instance, where `.keys` returns a sorted view of disjoint intervals.

```python
>>> d.domain()
[0,4]
>>> list(d.keys())
[[0,2), [2,4]]
>>> list(d.values())
['banana', 'orange']
>>> list(d.items())
[([0,2), 'banana'), ([2,4], 'orange')]

```

The `.keys`, `.values` and `.items` methods return exactly one element for each stored value (i.e., if two intervals share a value, they are merged into a disjunction), as illustrated next.
See [#44](https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/portion/issues/44#issuecomment-710199687) to know how to obtained a sorted list of atomic intervals instead.

```python
>>> d = P.IntervalDict()
>>> d[P.closed(0, 1)] = d[P.closed(2, 3)] = 'peach'
>>> list(d.items())
[([0,1] | [2,3], 'peach')]

```


Two `IntervalDict` instances can be combined together using the `.combine` method.
This method returns a new `IntervalDict` whose keys and values are taken from the two
source `IntervalDict`. Values corresponding to non-intersecting keys are simply copied,
while values corresponding to intersecting keys are combined together using the provided
function, as illustrated hereafter:

```python
>>> d1 = P.IntervalDict({P.closed(0, 2): 'banana'})
>>> d2 = P.IntervalDict({P.closed(1, 3): 'orange'})
>>> concat = lambda x, y: x + '/' + y
>>> d1.combine(d2, how=concat)
{[0,1): 'banana', [1,2]: 'banana/orange', (2,3]: 'orange'}

```

Resulting keys always correspond to an outer join. Other joins can be easily simulated
by querying the resulting `IntervalDict` as follows:

```python
>>> d = d1.combine(d2, how=concat)
>>> d[d1.domain()]  # Left join
{[0,1): 'banana', [1,2]: 'banana/orange'}
>>> d[d2.domain()]  # Right join
{[1,2]: 'banana/orange', (2,3]: 'orange'}
>>> d[d1.domain() & d2.domain()]  # Inner join
{[1,2]: 'banana/orange'}

Finally, similarly to a `dict`, an `IntervalDict` also supports `len`, `in` and `del`, and defines
`.clear`, `.copy`, `.update`, `.pop`, `.popitem`, and `.setdefault`.
For convenience, one can export the content of an `IntervalDict` to a classical Python `dict` using
the `as_dict` method.

### Import & export intervals to strings

Intervals can be exported to string, either using `repr` (as illustrated above) or with the `to_string` function.

```python
>>> P.to_string(P.closedopen(0, 1))
'[0,1)'

```

The way string representations are built can be easily parametrized using the various parameters supported by
`to_string`:

```python
>>> params = {
...   'disj': ' or ',
...   'sep': ' - ',
...   'left_closed': '<',
...   'right_closed': '>',
...   'left_open': '..',
...   'right_open': '..',
...   'pinf': '+oo',
...   'ninf': '-oo',
...   'conv': lambda v: '"{}"'.format(v),
... }
>>> x = P.openclosed(0, 1) | P.closed(2, P.inf)
>>> P.to_string(x, **params)
'.."0" - "1"> or <"2" - +oo..'

```

Similarly, intervals can be created from a string using the `from_string` function.
A conversion function (`conv` parameter) has to be provided to convert a bound (as string) to a value.

```python
>>> P.from_string('[0, 1]', conv=int) == P.closed(0, 1)
True
>>> P.from_string('[1.2]', conv=float) == P.singleton(1.2)
True
>>> converter = lambda s: datetime.datetime.strptime(s, '%Y/%m/%d')
>>> P.from_string('[2011/03/15, 2013/10/10]', conv=converter)
[datetime.datetime(2011, 3, 15, 0, 0),datetime.datetime(2013, 10, 10, 0, 0)]

```

Similarly to `to_string`, function `from_string` can be parametrized to deal with more elaborated inputs.
Notice that as `from_string` expects regular expression patterns, we need to escape some characters.

```python
>>> s = '.."0" - "1"> or <"2" - +oo..'
>>> params = {
...   'disj': ' or ',
...   'sep': ' - ',
...   'left_closed': '<',
...   'right_closed': '>',
...   'left_open': r'\.\.',  # from_string expects regular expression patterns
...   'right_open': r'\.\.',  # from_string expects regular expression patterns
...   'pinf': r'\+oo',  # from_string expects regular expression patterns
...   'ninf': '-oo',
...   'conv': lambda v: int(v[1:-1]),
... }
>>> P.from_string(s, **params)
(0,1] | [2,+inf)

```

When a bound contains a comma or has a representation that cannot be automatically parsed with `from_string`,
the `bound` parameter can be used to specify the regular expression that should be used to match its representation.

```python
>>> s = '[(0, 1), (2, 3)]'  # Bounds are expected to be tuples
>>> P.from_string(s, conv=eval, bound=r'\(.+?\)')
[(0, 1),(2, 3)]

```

### Import & export intervals to Python built-in data types

Intervals can also be exported to a list of 4-uples with `to_data`, e.g., to support JSON serialization.
`P.CLOSED` and `P.OPEN` are represented by Boolean values `True` (inclusive) and `False` (exclusive).

```python
>>> P.to_data(P.openclosed(0, 2))
[(False, 0, 2, True)]

```

The values used to represent positive and negative infinities can be specified with
`pinf` and `ninf`. They default to `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')` respectively.

```python
>>> x = P.openclosed(0, 1) | P.closedopen(2, P.inf)
>>> P.to_data(x)
[(False, 0, 1, True), (True, 2, inf, False)]

```

The function to convert bounds can be specified with the `conv` parameter.

```python
>>> x = P.closedopen(datetime.date(2011, 3, 15), datetime.date(2013, 10, 10))
>>> P.to_data(x, conv=lambda v: (v.year, v.month, v.day))
[(True, (2011, 3, 15), (2013, 10, 10), False)]

```

Intervals can be imported from such a list of 4-tuples with `from_data`.
The same set of parameters can be used to specify how bounds and infinities are converted.

```python
>>> x = [(True, (2011, 3, 15), (2013, 10, 10), False)]
>>> P.from_data(x, conv=lambda v: datetime.date(*v))
[datetime.date(2011, 3, 15),datetime.date(2013, 10, 10))

```
